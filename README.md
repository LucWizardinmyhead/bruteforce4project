Ensure you have enc.zip and rockyou.txt in the same directory as this script before running it.
You can run this script in a Python environment using the available zip file module.
You can use any zip file just change the name of the zip file in the code 'enc.zip' to your file name.
Also, you might want to add the longer version of rockyou.txt if you plan to use it
